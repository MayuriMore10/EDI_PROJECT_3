## Field Length Validation

The system now performs automatic field length validation:

- **Green Background**: Mandatory field present with correct length
- **Red Background**: Mandatory field missing OR present with incorrect length
- **Yellow Background**: Optional field present with correct length
- **White Background**: Optional field missing

### Length Error Display

When a field length doesn't match the specification, the system displays:
- âš  Field length error with actual vs expected length
- Red highlighting of the affected field
- Detailed error message showing the mismatch
